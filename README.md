# Repository

- This repository is for a web application that allows the user to track their spending and manage their budget.

# Technology-Used

- To build this project I was provided with the working product and was tasked in making it into a progressive web application. 

- To accomplish this goal I used IndexDB to store the the persistent data from the front-end in case the user loses their internet connection. 

- We then use MongoDB & Mongoose to to store this data once the internet connection is reestablished and input the information from the user.

- Also to provided this functionality I had to create a service-worker to manage which files to save & use for the offline application.

- And finally used manifest.webmanifest to carry over the icon images to be used in offline mode as well.

# User-Story

- To begin the application simply load up the web site and begin to input their transactions and their relevant amount.

- Once a transaction is submitted it's then added to the list of items below and a dynamic chart is generated.

- The user can also remove items by plugging in the matching information and pressing 'subtract funds.'
